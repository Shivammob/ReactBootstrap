                          Data processing may partially be performed by our
                          service providers. In addition to the service
                          providers stated in this Privacy Policy, this may
                          especially include data centers, software providers
                          (e.g., for log file management or sending
                          newsletters), IT service providers, help desks,
                          agencies, market research companies, group companies
                          and consulting firms. If we transfer data to our
                          service providers, the service providers may only use
                          this data for the performance of their tasks. Service
                          providers are diligently selected and commissioned by
                          us. If these service providers process your data
                          outside of the European Union, your data may be
                          transferred to a country with lower data protection
                          standards than in the European Union. For such cases,
                          Realtime Technologies ensures that the respective
                          service providers guarantee an equivalent level of
                          data protection contractually or similarly (e.g., by
                          concluding standard contractual clauses with the
                          service provider or through certification of the
                          service provider under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield).
                          You may receive copies of these guarantees from our
                          data protection officer.
